# **Session 1 (RCT and Regression)**

We will start with the basics of RCT and Regression, the primary reading is Chapter 1, 2 and 3 of @angrist_2009. The key idea here is to understand why RCT is considered to be the gold standard of causal inference and how regression can be used to estimate causal effects.
